# MSBA-Projects
Assignments and projects completed while pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics. 

The work in this repository focuses on projects and assignments completed while at the University of Texas. This body of work presented here should serve as a guide for what I learned while earning my master's and serve as a base for my knowledge of coding and analytics models, that I have continued to build on while working professionally as a data scientist.
